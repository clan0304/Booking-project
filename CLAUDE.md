## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js Server Actions, API Routes
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Clerk (Email/Password + Google OAuth)
- **Authorization:** Supabase (roles stored in database only)
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage (for user photos, team member photos, venue photos)
- **Data Access:** Service Role (server-side) for all operations
- **Timezone Handling:** UTC-safe date/time utilities for Melbourne (UTC+10/+11)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Principles

1. **Unified User Table**

   - Single `users` table for all user types (clients, team members, admins)
   - Avoids data duplication and inconsistencies
   - Handles role transitions seamlessly (e.g., client becomes team member)

2. **Separation of Concerns: Authentication vs Authorization**

   - **Clerk**: Handles authentication only (sign in/up, user identity)
   - **Supabase**: Single source of truth for authorization (roles, permissions)
   - No syncing needed between systems!
   - Roles stored ONLY in Supabase

3. **Role-Based Access Control**

   - Users can have multiple roles stored as an array: `['client', 'team_member', 'admin']`
   - Permissions enforced server-side with explicit filtering
   - Middleware queries Supabase to check roles for route protection
   - Role changes take effect immediately (no sign out/in required!)

4. **Server-Side Data Access Pattern**

   - **All operations use Service Role** (`supabaseAdmin`)
   - Server-side filtering ensures users only access their data
   - Auth checks via `requireAuth()`, `requireStaff()`, `requireAdmin()`
   - RLS policies disabled (Service Role bypasses them anyway)

5. **Timezone-Safe Date Handling** ‚úÖ NEW
   - All dates stored as YYYY-MM-DD strings (no timezone)
   - UTC-safe parsing prevents timezone conversion bugs
   - Works correctly in Melbourne (UTC+10/+11) year-round
   - Handles daylight saving time transitions automatically

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Table Structure Overview

**1. Users Table**

- Stores all users (clients, team members, admins)
- Fields: id, clerk_user_id (nullable), email, first_name, last_name, phone_number, birthday, photo_url, roles (array), is_registered, onboarding_completed, alert_note
- Indexes on: clerk_user_id, email, roles
- **RLS:** Disabled (Service Role bypasses it)
- **IMPORTANT:** `roles` array is the ONLY source of truth for permissions

**2. Client Notes Table**

- Stores notes about clients (for team/admin reference)
- Fields: id, client_id, note, created_by, updated_by, timestamps
- Separate table for better audit trail and performance
- **RLS:** Disabled

**3. Team Members Table**

- Additional info for team members
- Fields: id, user_id (FK to users), position, bio, specialties (array), is_active, hire_date
- One-to-one relationship with users table
- **RLS:** Disabled

**4. Venues Table**

- Stores salon/venue locations for marketplace
- Fields: id, name, address, phone_number (nullable), photo_url (nullable), slug (unique), is_listed, created_by, timestamps
- Slug format: `venue-name-123456` (auto-generated, 6 unique digits)
- Indexes on: slug, is_listed, created_at
- **RLS:** Disabled
- **Purpose:** Multi-location support, each venue gets unique booking URL

**5. Venue Operating Hours Table** ‚úÖ NEW

- Stores regular business hours for each venue
- Fields: id, venue_id (FK), day_of_week (0-6), start_time, end_time, is_closed
- Unique constraint: (venue_id, day_of_week)
- **Purpose:** Define when venue is open/closed each day of week

**6. Team Member Venues Table** ‚úÖ NEW

- Junction table for team member assignments to venues
- Fields: id, team_member_id (FK to users), venue_id (FK), is_active
- Unique constraint: (team_member_id, venue_id)
- **Purpose:** Track which team members work at which venues

**7. Shifts Table** ‚úÖ NEW

- Stores individual work shifts for team members
- Fields: id, team_member_id (FK), venue_id (FK), shift_date (date), start_time, end_time, notes, created_by
- Unique constraint: (team_member_id, venue_id, shift_date)
- Indexes on: shift_date, team_member_id, venue_id
- **Purpose:** Schedule management and availability tracking

**8. Venue Closed Days Table** ‚úÖ NEW

- Stores dates when venue is closed (holidays, special events)
- Fields: id, venue_id (FK), closed_date (date), reason, is_recurring, recurrence_rule, created_by
- Unique constraint: (venue_id, closed_date)
- **Purpose:** Mark venue closures, prevent bookings on closed days

**9. Supabase Storage Buckets**

- **`user-photos`**: User profile photos
  - Public read access
  - Server-side upload/delete (via Service Role)
  - Path: `{clerk_user_id}/{timestamp}-{filename}`
- **`team-member-photos`**: Team member profile photos
  - Public read access
  - Server-side upload/delete (via Service Role)
  - Path: `{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}`
- **`venue-photos`**: Venue/location photos
  - Public read access
  - Server-side upload/delete (via Service Role)
  - Path: `venues/{timestamp}-{filename}`

### Why This Structure?

- **Unified users table:** Handles role transitions seamlessly
- **Separate notes table:** Better performance, audit trail, and queryability
- **Team members extension:** Keeps user data normalized while allowing role-specific fields
- **Venues table:** Supports multi-location businesses, unique booking URLs per venue
- **Scheduling tables:** Flexible shift management with venue assignments
- **Closed days tracking:** Prevents conflicts and handles special closures
- **No RLS policies:** Simpler maintenance, security enforced in application code
- **Roles in database only:** No syncing complexity, instant updates

## üíª Implementation Patterns

### Timezone-Safe Date Handling Pattern ‚úÖ NEW

**Critical for Melbourne (UTC+10/+11):**

```typescript
// lib/shift-helpers.ts

// ALWAYS parse dates in UTC to avoid timezone bugs
function parseUTCDate(dateStr: string): Date {
  return new Date(dateStr + 'T00:00:00Z'); // Z = UTC!
}

// ALWAYS use UTC methods
export function getDayOfWeek(dateStr: string): number {
  const date = parseUTCDate(dateStr);
  return date.getUTCDay(); // Not .getDay()!
}

// ALWAYS format dates in UTC
export function formatDate(date: Date): string {
  const year = date.getUTCFullYear();
  const month = String(date.getUTCMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
  const day = String(date.getUTCDate()).padStart(2, '0');
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
}
```

**Why This Matters:**

- Database stores dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` (no timezone)
- JavaScript `new Date("2025-10-15")` interprets as local time
- In Melbourne, this can shift the date by 1 day in UTC
- Using UTC methods ensures dates stay correct year-round
- Handles daylight saving transitions automatically

**Example Bug Without UTC:**

```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Timezone-dependent
const date = new Date('2025-10-15T00:00:00'); // Melbourne time!
date.getDay(); // Returns wrong day in UTC!

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: UTC-explicit
const date = new Date('2025-10-15T00:00:00Z'); // UTC!
date.getUTCDay(); // Always correct!
```

## üîÆ Lessons Learned

### Timezone Handling in Melbourne

**Problem Discovered:**

- JavaScript `new Date("2025-10-15T00:00:00")` interprets as local Melbourne time
- When converted to UTC, date could shift by 10-11 hours
- Caused calendar to show wrong days and shifts to save 1 day off

**Solution Implemented:**

- Always parse dates with UTC: `new Date("2025-10-15T00:00:00Z")`
- Always use UTC methods: `getUTCDay()`, `setUTCDate()`, `getUTCFullYear()`
- Never use local timezone methods: `getDay()`, `setDate()`, `getFullYear()`
- Keep dates as YYYY-MM-DD strings throughout application
- No Date object conversions in browser or server until final display

**Key Principle:**

> "When working with dates in databases, always think in UTC, never in local time."

This applies to ANY timezone, not just Melbourne! The issue affects all locations during daylight saving transitions.
