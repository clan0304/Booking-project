## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js Server Actions, API Routes
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Clerk (Email/Password + Google OAuth)
- **Authorization:** Supabase (roles stored in database only)
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage (for user photos, team member photos, venue photos)
- **Data Access:** Service Role (server-side) for all operations
- **Timezone Handling:** UTC-safe date/time utilities for Melbourne (UTC+10/+11)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Principles

1. **Unified User Table**

   - Single `users` table for all user types (clients, team members, admins)
   - Avoids data duplication and inconsistencies
   - Handles role transitions seamlessly (e.g., client becomes team member)

2. **Separation of Concerns: Authentication vs Authorization**

   - **Clerk**: Handles authentication only (sign in/up, user identity)
   - **Supabase**: Single source of truth for authorization (roles, permissions)
   - No syncing needed between systems!
   - Roles stored ONLY in Supabase

3. **Role-Based Access Control**

   - Users can have multiple roles stored as an array: `['client', 'team_member', 'admin']`
   - Permissions enforced server-side with explicit filtering
   - Middleware queries Supabase to check roles for route protection
   - Role changes take effect immediately (no sign out/in required!)

4. **Server-Side Data Access Pattern**

   - **All operations use Service Role** (`supabaseAdmin`)
   - Server-side filtering ensures users only access their data
   - Auth checks via `requireAuth()`, `requireStaff()`, `requireAdmin()`
   - RLS policies disabled (Service Role bypasses them anyway)

5. **Timezone-Safe Date Handling** ‚úÖ
   - All dates stored as YYYY-MM-DD strings (no timezone)
   - UTC-safe parsing prevents timezone conversion bugs
   - Works correctly in Melbourne (UTC+10/+11) year-round
   - Handles daylight saving time transitions automatically

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Table Structure Overview

**1. Users Table**

- Stores all users (clients, team members, admins)
- Fields: id, clerk_user_id (nullable), email, first_name, last_name, phone_number, birthday, photo_url, roles (array), is_registered, onboarding_completed, alert_note
- Indexes on: clerk_user_id, email, roles
- **RLS:** Disabled (Service Role bypasses it)
- **IMPORTANT:** `roles` array is the ONLY source of truth for permissions

**2. Client Notes Table**

- Stores notes about clients (for team/admin reference)
- Fields: id, client_id, note, created_by, updated_by, timestamps
- Separate table for better audit trail and performance
- **RLS:** Disabled

**3. Team Members Table**

- Additional info for team members
- Fields: id, user_id (FK to users), position, bio, specialties (array), is_active, hire_date
- One-to-one relationship with users table
- **RLS:** Disabled

**4. Venues Table**

- Stores salon/venue locations for marketplace
- Fields: id, name, address, phone_number (nullable), photo_url (nullable), slug (unique), is_listed, created_by, timestamps
- Slug format: `venue-name-123456` (auto-generated, 6 unique digits)
- Indexes on: slug, is_listed, created_at
- **RLS:** Disabled
- **Purpose:** Multi-location support, each venue gets unique booking URL

**5. Venue Operating Hours Table** ‚úÖ

- Stores regular business hours for each venue
- Fields: id, venue_id (FK), day_of_week (0-6), start_time, end_time, is_closed
- Unique constraint: (venue_id, day_of_week)
- **Purpose:** Define when venue is open/closed each day of week

**6. Team Member Venues Table** ‚úÖ

- Junction table for team member assignments to venues
- Fields: id, team_member_id (FK to users), venue_id (FK), is_active
- Unique constraint: (team_member_id, venue_id)
- **Purpose:** Track which team members work at which venues
- **Note:** Uses `is_active` for soft deletes (preserves assignment history)

**7. Shifts Table** ‚úÖ

- Stores individual work shifts for team members
- Fields: id, team_member_id (FK), venue_id (FK), shift_date (date), start_time, end_time, notes, created_by
- Unique constraint: (team_member_id, venue_id, shift_date)
- Indexes on: shift_date, team_member_id, venue_id
- **Purpose:** Schedule management and availability tracking

**8. Venue Closed Days Table** ‚úÖ

- Stores dates when venue is closed (holidays, special events)
- Fields: id, venue_id (FK), closed_date (date), reason, is_recurring, recurrence_rule, created_by
- Unique constraint: (venue_id, closed_date)
- **Purpose:** Mark venue closures, prevent bookings on closed days

**9. Supabase Storage Buckets**

- **`user-photos`**: User profile photos
  - Public read access
  - Server-side upload/delete (via Service Role)
  - Path: `{clerk_user_id}/{timestamp}-{filename}` or `clients/{timestamp}-{filename}`
- **`team-member-photos`**: Team member profile photos
  - Public read access
  - Server-side upload/delete (via Service Role)
  - Path: `{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}`
- **`venue-photos`**: Venue/location photos
  - Public read access
  - Server-side upload/delete (via Service Role)
  - Path: `venues/{timestamp}-{filename}`

### Why This Structure?

- **Unified users table:** Handles role transitions seamlessly
- **Separate notes table:** Better performance, audit trail, and queryability
- **Team members extension:** Keeps user data normalized while allowing role-specific fields
- **Venues table:** Supports multi-location businesses, unique booking URLs per venue
- **Scheduling tables:** Flexible shift management with venue assignments
- **Closed days tracking:** Prevents conflicts and handles special closures
- **Soft deletes:** `is_active` flag preserves assignment history for auditing
- **No RLS policies:** Simpler maintenance, security enforced in application code
- **Roles in database only:** No syncing complexity, instant updates

## üéØ Critical Decisions Summary

| Decision                  | Choice                            | Rationale                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Access Pattern**   | Service Role (server-side)        | Simpler, more secure, easier to maintain               |
| **Authorization Pattern** | Supabase only (no Clerk metadata) | Single source of truth, instant updates, no syncing    |
| **Role Storage**          | Supabase users.roles ONLY         | No JWT caching issues, instant changes, simpler        |
| **Role Changes**          | Immediate (no re-auth)            | Better UX, middleware queries DB on each request       |
| **Client Data Access**    | Server-side with filtering        | Users access own data via filtered queries             |
| **RLS Policies**          | Disabled                          | Not needed with Service Role                           |
| **User Table Structure**  | Unified table with roles array    | Handles role transitions, single source of truth       |
| **Authentication**        | Clerk                             | Industry standard, OAuth support, handles auth only    |
| **Timezone Handling**     | UTC-safe everywhere               | Prevents bugs in Melbourne (UTC+10/+11), handles DST   |
| **Date Storage**          | YYYY-MM-DD strings                | No timezone, consistent across all systems             |
| **Date Parsing**          | Always add 'Z' suffix             | Forces UTC interpretation, no local timezone issues    |
| **Date Methods**          | Use getUTCDay(), setUTCDate()     | Ensures consistent behavior regardless of local time   |
| **Week Format**           | Monday-Sunday (ISO 8601)          | Industry standard, aligns with business week           |
| **Client Filtering**      | Fetch + Filter in JavaScript      | Reliable for <10K records, easier to maintain          |
| **Array Filtering**       | JavaScript over PostgREST         | PostgREST array syntax is tricky and version-dependent |
| **Performance Trade-off** | Slight over-fetching acceptable   | <100ms impact for typical salon, optimize when needed  |
| **Client Photos**         | Optional, gradient fallback       | Professional appearance, not all clients need photos   |
| **Table Design**          | Fresha-inspired columns           | Clean, scannable, industry-standard UX                 |
| **Registered Clients**    | Cannot be deleted                 | Protects users with active accounts                    |
| **Sales Column**          | Show ¬£0.00 placeholder            | Indicates feature exists, ready for Phase 5            |
| **TypeScript Types**      | Explicit interfaces, no `any`     | Type safety, better IDE support, fewer bugs            |

## üîÆ Lessons Learned

### Client Role Filtering

**Problem Discovered:**

- PostgREST array operators are tricky and version-dependent
- `.not('roles', 'cs', '{team_member}')` syntax confusing
- `cs` (contains), `cd` (contained by), `ov` (overlaps) operators unclear
- Array negation doesn't always work as expected

**Solution Implemented:**

- Fetch all users with 'client' role first
- Filter in JavaScript to exclude team members and admins
- More reliable and easier to debug
- Performance negligible for typical salon size (<10K clients)

**Key Principle:**

> "For small to medium datasets (<10K records), JavaScript filtering after fetch is more maintainable than complex database queries. Optimize when you have real performance data."

### Date Formatting Hydration

**Problem Discovered:**

- `toLocaleDateString()` without locale caused hydration mismatch
- Server used one locale (AU: DD/MM/YYYY), client used another (US: MM/DD/YYYY)
- React hydration error: "text didn't match the client"

**Solution Implemented:**

- Always specify locale in `toLocaleDateString('en-US', {...})`
- Consistent formatting on both server and client
- Prevents hydration mismatches

**Key Principle:**

> "Always specify locale and format options for date/time rendering to ensure server-client consistency."

### Timezone Handling in Melbourne

**Problem Discovered:**

- JavaScript `new Date("2025-10-15T00:00:00")` interprets as local Melbourne time
- When converted to UTC, date could shift by 10-11 hours
- Caused calendar to show wrong days and shifts to save 1 day off

**Solution Implemented:**

- Always parse dates with UTC: `new Date("2025-10-15T00:00:00Z")`
- Always use UTC methods: `getUTCDay()`, `setUTCDate()`, `getUTCFullYear()`
- Never use local timezone methods: `getDay()`, `setDate()`, `getFullYear()`
- Keep dates as YYYY-MM-DD strings throughout application

**Key Principle:**

> "When working with dates in databases, always think in UTC, never in local time."

### TypeScript Type Safety

**Problem Discovered:**

- Using `any` types in complex data structures led to runtime errors
- Supabase query results have nested objects that need proper typing
- Modal state management became error-prone without explicit types

**Solution Implemented:**

- Created explicit interfaces for all database query results
- Added proper types for component props and state
- Handled both array and single object returns from Supabase
- Used type assertions only when necessary with proper validation

**Key Principle:**

> "Invest time in proper TypeScript types upfront‚Äîthey catch bugs before they reach production."
