## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js Server Actions, API Routes
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Clerk (Email/Password + Google OAuth)
- **Authorization:** Supabase (roles stored in database only)
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage (for user photos, team member photos, venue photos)
- **Data Access:** Service Role (server-side) for all operations
- **Timezone Handling:** UTC-safe date/time utilities for Melbourne (UTC+10/+11)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Principles

1. **Unified User Table**

   - Single `users` table for all user types (clients, team members, admins)
   - Avoids data duplication and inconsistencies
   - Handles role transitions seamlessly (e.g., client becomes team member)

2. **Separation of Concerns: Authentication vs Authorization**

   - **Clerk**: Handles authentication only (sign in/up, user identity)
   - **Supabase**: Single source of truth for authorization (roles, permissions)
   - No syncing needed between systems!
   - Roles stored ONLY in Supabase

3. **Role-Based Access Control**

   - Users can have multiple roles stored as an array: `['client', 'team_member', 'admin']`
   - Permissions enforced server-side with explicit filtering
   - Middleware queries Supabase to check roles for route protection
   - Role changes take effect immediately (no sign out/in required!)

4. **Server-Side Data Access Pattern**

   - **All operations use Service Role** (`supabaseAdmin`)
   - Server-side filtering ensures users only access their data
   - Auth checks via `requireAuth()`, `requireStaff()`, `requireAdmin()`
   - RLS policies disabled (Service Role bypasses them anyway)

5. **Timezone-Safe Date Handling** ‚úÖ
   - All dates stored as YYYY-MM-DD strings (no timezone)
   - UTC-safe parsing prevents timezone conversion bugs
   - Works correctly in Melbourne (UTC+10/+11) year-round
   - Handles daylight saving time transitions automatically

## üîÆ Lessons Learned

### Kiosk Mode Security Pattern

**Implementation:**

- Admin functions receive optional `teamMemberId` parameter
- Server actions check: `isAdmin && teamMemberId ? teamMemberId : supabaseUserId`
- Non-admin users automatically restricted to own ID
- Admin with no teamMemberId also restricted to own ID
- Security enforced server-side, not client-side

**Key Principle:**

> "For multi-user management, pass target user ID as optional parameter. Always verify admin status server-side before using provided ID."

### JSONB for Flexible Data

**Break Tracking Implementation:**

- Breaks stored as JSONB array: `[{start: timestamp, end: timestamp | null}]`
- Allows unlimited breaks per shift
- Current break tracked separately: `current_break_start`
- Easy to query and calculate total break time
- Schema remains flexible for future additions

**Key Principle:**

> "Use JSONB for arrays of structured data that don't need complex queries. Simpler than junction tables for 1:N relationships when N items are always queried together."

### Pay Rate Precedence Pattern

**NULL vs Set Value Overrides:**

- NULL in custom rate = use system default (auto-updates)
- Set value in custom rate = locked override (manual updates only)
- Database function checks custom first, falls back to default
- Clear intent: NULL means "no preference", value means "locked"

**Key Principle:**

> "For override patterns, NULL = 'inherit default' (auto-updates), explicit value = 'locked override' (manual only). Makes intent clear and behavior predictable."

### Effective Rate Calculation

**Date-Aware Rate Logic:**

- Check if date is public holiday ‚Üí use holiday rate
- Else check day of week ‚Üí use weekday/Saturday/Sunday rate
- Always check custom rates first, then default rates
- Database function keeps logic centralized
- Single source of truth for all payroll calculations

**Key Principle:**

> "Centralize complex business logic in database functions. Ensures consistency across all application layers and simplifies testing."

### Modal State Synchronization

**Problem Discovered:**

- Edit modals initialized state from props only on first render
- When data updated after submission, modal state didn't sync
- `useState(initialValue)` ignores new prop values after first render
- Had to refresh entire page to see updated values in edit modal

**Solution Implemented:**

- Added `useEffect` to sync state when modal opens or props change
- Reset all form fields from props when `isOpen` becomes true
- Monitors both `isOpen` and data props in dependency array
- Clears error states and resets UI when modal opens

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen) {
    setName(category.name);
    setDescription(category.description || '');
    setSelectedColor(category.color);
    setError('');
  }
}, [isOpen, category]);
```

**Key Principle:**

> "Edit modals must sync state with props when opened. `useState` initial values only run once‚Äîuse `useEffect` to re-sync when props change."

### List State Management with Router Refresh

**Problem Discovered:**

- List component stored data in state: `const [services] = useState(initialServices)`
- After mutations, `router.refresh()` fetched new data from server
- Parent component re-rendered with fresh props
- But child component's state never updated (stale data)
- UI showed old values until full page refresh

**Solution Implemented:**

- Changed from state to direct props usage: `const services = initialServices`
- Removed unnecessary state that duplicates props
- Now when parent re-renders with new data, child automatically shows it
- `router.refresh()` pattern works perfectly

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: State never updates
const [services] = useState(initialServices);

// ‚úÖ AFTER: Auto-updates with props
const services = initialServices;
```

**Key Principle:**

> "Don't store props in state if you want automatic updates. Use props directly‚Äîthey update when parent re-renders. Reserve state for UI-only values like search queries."

### Service Types Architecture

**Decision Made:**

- Three service types in one table with `type` field
- `service`: Regular bookable service or variant option
- `variant_group`: Parent showing variant options modal (not directly bookable)
- `bundle`: Package of multiple services

**Why This Works:**

- Single table with flexible `type` field is simpler than 3 separate tables
- Parent-child relationship via `parent_service_id` for variants
- Bundles use junction table `bundle_items` for many-to-many
- Price calculation: variants show "from ¬£X" (minimum variant price)
- `is_bookable` flag controls booking behavior per type

**Key Principle:**

> "Use type discriminators in a single table when entities share 80% of fields. Separate tables when they're fundamentally different."

### Custom Pricing Architecture

**Decision Made:**

- Store custom price/duration in `service_team_members` table
- NULL = use service default (auto-updates with service changes)
- Set value = locked override (won't change with service updates)
- Helper functions: `get_effective_price()`, `get_effective_duration()`

**Why This Works:**

- No service duplication needed for different team members
- Service updates automatically apply to all team members (unless overridden)
- Team members can have individualized rates when needed
- Database functions encapsulate pricing logic
- Clean separation of concerns

**Key Principle:**

> "For optional overrides, use NULL to mean 'use default' and explicit values to mean 'locked override'. Provides flexibility without complexity."

### Client Role Filtering

**Problem Discovered:**

- PostgREST array operators are tricky and version-dependent
- `.not('roles', 'cs', '{team_member}')` syntax confusing
- `cs` (contains), `cd` (contained by), `ov` (overlaps) operators unclear
- Array negation doesn't always work as expected

**Solution Implemented:**

- Fetch all users with 'client' role first
- Filter in JavaScript to exclude team members and admins
- More reliable and easier to debug
- Performance negligible for typical salon size (<10K clients)

**Key Principle:**

> "For small to medium datasets (<10K records), JavaScript filtering after fetch is more maintainable than complex database queries. Optimize when you have real performance data."

### Date Formatting Hydration

**Problem Discovered:**

- `toLocaleDateString()` without locale caused hydration mismatch
- Server used one locale (AU: DD/MM/YYYY), client used another (US: MM/DD/YYYY)
- React hydration error: "text didn't match the client"

**Solution Implemented:**

- Always specify locale in `toLocaleDateString('en-US', {...})`
- Consistent formatting on both server and client
- Prevents hydration mismatches

**Key Principle:**

> "Always specify locale and format options for date/time rendering to ensure server-client consistency."

### Timezone Handling in Melbourne

**Problem Discovered:**

- JavaScript `new Date("2025-10-15T00:00:00")` interprets as local Melbourne time
- When converted to UTC, date could shift by 10-11 hours
- Caused calendar to show wrong days and shifts to save 1 day off

**Solution Implemented:**

- Always parse dates with UTC: `new Date("2025-10-15T00:00:00Z")`
- Always use UTC methods: `getUTCDay()`, `setUTCDate()`, `getUTCFullYear()`
- Never use local timezone methods: `getDay()`, `setDate()`, `getFullYear()`
- Keep dates as YYYY-MM-DD strings throughout application

**Key Principle:**

> "When working with dates in databases, always think in UTC, never in local time."

### TypeScript Type Safety

**Problem Discovered:**

- Using `any` types in complex data structures led to runtime errors
- Supabase query results have nested objects that need proper typing
- Modal state management became error-prone without explicit types

**Solution Implemented:**

- Created explicit interfaces for all database query results
- Added proper types for component props and state
- Handled both array and single object returns from Supabase
- Used type assertions only when necessary with proper validation

**Key Principle:**

> "Invest time in proper TypeScript types upfront‚Äîthey catch bugs before they reach production."
